/*Compression is a process that reduces the dynamic range of an audio signal by attenuating the amplitude of the signal above a certain threshold. 
threshold: The level above which compression occurs. A lower value will affect more of the signal, while a higher value will affect less. 
            It's set in the range of [0.0, 1.0], where 0.0 corresponds to the minimum amplitude and 1.0 to the maximum amplitude.
ratio: Determines the amount of compression applied to the signal above the threshold. 
        A higher ratio results in more aggressive compression, while a lower ratio results in gentler compression. 
        A ratio of 1:1 means no compression is applied, while a ratio of âˆž:1 means that the output level will not increase beyond the threshold.
